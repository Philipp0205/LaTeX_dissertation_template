\chapter{Introduction}

“Sheet metal forming has been employed for centuries in diverse manufacturing industries to create a wide range of products that may be used in several applications. Among different forming techniques, sheet bending and stamping can be considered the most important variants in forming industry. These techniques have been continuously improved in recent decades to meet the growing need for lightweight metallic components in the automotive sector in order to address environmental concerns about energy efficiency and emissions [1,2].” (Cruz et al., 2021, p. 1)

"In order to predict springback with minimum errors, this paper presents the idea for the development of machine learning models using tree-based learning algorithms (A class of machine learning algorithms). Tree-based learning algorithms are employed because they are precise, consistent, and easy to understand." \cite{baig_machinelearningprediction_2021}
