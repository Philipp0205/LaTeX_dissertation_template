\subsection{Dataset Generation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 200 samples where created with the measurements 50x100mm
    \item Each sample was folded one in half so that 50mm where before the bend and 50mm after.
    \item 
    \item 
    \item Recycled afterwards
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Measurement}

\textbf{Bend deduction} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The bending line was marked 
    \item After the bend a Caliper was used to measure the side lengths (A + B).
\end{itemize}
